Data engineering	Data engineers are responsible for turning raw data into information that an organization can understand and use. Their work involves blending, testing, and optimizing data from numerous sources.
Data science	Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that focuses on extracting knowledge from data sets which are typically huge in amount. The field encompasses analysis, preparing data for analysis, and presenting findings to inform high-level decisions in an organization.
Data type	Data type refers to the type of value a variable has and what type of mathematical, relational or logical operations can be applied without causing an error.
Double quote	Symbol “ “ used to represent strings in Python.
Escape sequence	An escape sequence is two or more characters that often begin with an escape character that tell the computer to perform a function or command.
Expression	An expression is a combination of operators and operands that is interpreted to produce some other value.
Float	Python float () function is used to return a floating-point number from a number or a string representation of a numeric value.
Forward slash	Symbol “/“ used to perform various operation sin Python
Foundational	Denoting an underlying basis or principle; fundamental.
Immutable	Immutable Objects are of in-built datatypes like int, float, bool, string, Unicode, and tuple. In simple words, an immutable object can’t be changed after it is created.
Integer	An integer is the number zero (0), a positive natural number (1, 2, 3, and so on) or a negative integer with a minus sign (−1, −2, −3, and so on.)
Manipulate	Is the process of modifying a string or creating a new string by making changes to existing strings.
Mathematical conventions	A mathematical convention is a fact, name, notation, or usage which is generally agreed upon by mathematicians.
Mathematical expressions	Expressions in math are mathematical statements that have a minimum of two terms containing numbers or variables, or both, connected by an operator in between.
Mathematical operations	The mathematical “operation” refers to calculating a value using operands and a math operator.
Negative indexing	Allows you to access elements of a sequence (such as a list, a string, or a tuple) from the end, using negative numbers as indexes.
Operands	The quantity on which an operation is to be done.
Operators in Python	Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.
Parentheses	Parentheses is used to call an object.
Replicate	To make an exact copy of.
Sequence	A sequence is formally defined as a function whose domain is an interval of integers.
Single quote	Symbol ‘ ‘ used to represent strings in python.
Slicing in Python	Slicing is used to return a portion from defined list.
Special characters	A special character is one that is not considered a number or letter. Symbols, accent marks, and punctuation marks are considered special characters.
Stride value	Stride is the number of bytes from one row of pixels in memory to the next row of pixels in memory.
Strings	In Python, Strings are arrays of bytes representing Unicode characters.
Substring	A substring is a sequence of characters that are part of an original string.
Type casting	The process of converting one data type to another data type is called Typecasting or Type Coercion or Type Conversion.
Types in Python	Data types are the classification or categorization of data items. It represents the kind of value that tells what operations can be performed on a particular data.
Variables	Variables are containers for storing data values.

These terms are important for you to recognize when working in the industry, participating in user groups, and participating in other certificate programs.

Term	Definition
Aliasing	Aliasing refers to giving another name to a function or a variable.
Ampersand	A character typically "&" standing for the word "and."
Compound elements	Compound statements contain (groups of) other statements; they affect or control the execution of those other statements in some way.
Delimiter	A delimiter in Python is a character or sequence of characters used to separate or mark the boundaries between elements or fields within a larger data structure, such as a string or a file.
Dictionaries	A dictionary in Python is a data structure that stores a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique and associated with a specific value.
Function	A function is a block of code, defining a set procedure, which is executed only when it is called.
Immutable	Immutable Objects are of in-built datatypes like int, float, bool, string, Unicode, and tuple. In simple words, an immutable object can't be changed after it is created.
Intersection	The intersection of two given sets is the largest set, which contains all the elements that are common to both sets.
Keys	The keys () method in Python Dictionary, returns a view object that displays a list of all the keys in the dictionary in order of insertion using Python.
Lists	A list is any list of data items, separated by commas, inside square brackets.
Logic operations	In Python, logic operations refer to the use of logical operators such as "and," "or," and "not" to perform logical operations on Boolean values (True or False).
Mutable	Immutable objects are of in-built datatypes like int, float, bool, string, Unicode, and tuple. A mutable object can be changed after it is created.
Nesting	A nested function is simply a function within another function and is sometimes called an "inner function".
Ratings in python	Ratings in Python typically refer to a numerical or qualitative measure assigned to something to indicate its quality, performance, or value.
Set operations	Set operations in Python refer to mathematical operations performed on sets, which are unordered collections of unique elements.
Sets in python	A set is an unordered collection of unique elements.
Syntax	The rules that define the structure of the language for python is called its syntax.
Tuples	These are used store multiple items in a single variable.
Type casting	In python, this is converting one data type to another.
Variables	In python, a variable is a symbolic name or identifier used to store and manipulate data. Variables serve as containers for values, and these values can be of various data types, including numbers, strings, lists, and more.
Venn diagram	A Venn diagram is a graphical representation that uses overlapping circles to illustrate the relationships and commonalities between sets or groups of items.
Versatile data	Versatile data, in a general context, refers to data that can be used in multiple ways, is adaptable to different applications or purposes, and is not restricted to a specific use case.
